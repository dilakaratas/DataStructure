In this homework,search engine is created. The speed of two different data structures for the search engine architectures compared. The search engines in real life search hundreds of millions web pages to see if they have the words that you have typed, and they can do this for thousands of users at a given time. In order to do these searches really fast, search engines such as Google do a lot of what we call preprocessing of the pages they search; that is, they transform the contents of a web page which for the purposes of this homework into a structure that can be searched very fast.
In this homework, the documents provided to preprocessed. For each unique word, a node into both of the data structures Binary Search Tree (BST) and Hash Table inserted. Of course, the details such as the document name which the word appears in and the number of times the word appears in each document is keeped in track.
